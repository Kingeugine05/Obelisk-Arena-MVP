# Obelisk Arena Protocol

## Overview

Obelisk Arena is a decentralized gaming protocol that enables cross-chain battles, NFT integration, and community governance. The protocol consists of several key components:

1. **Governance System**: On-chain voting for protocol changes and treasury management
2. **Battle System**: Core game mechanics and matchmaking
3. **NFT Integration**: Character/item ownership and trading
4. **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Asset transfer between supported blockchains

## Governance

The Obelisk Arena governance system allows token holders to propose and vote on changes to the protocol. Governance is managed through the ObeliskGovernance smart contract.

### Proposal Types

- **Parameter Change**: Modify protocol parameters (e.g., fee structures, reward rates)
- **Protocol Upgrade**: Implement new features or modify existing ones
- **Treasury Spending**: Allocate funds from the protocol treasury
- **Emergency Action**: Critical security fixes or emergency measures

### Voting Process

1. **Proposal Creation**: Any token holder can create a proposal
2. **Voting Period**: 7-day period where token holders can vote for or against
3. **Execution Delay**: 2-day delay after voting ends before implementation
4. **Implementation**: Automatic execution of approved proposals

## Battle System

The battle system is the core gameplay mechanic of Obelisk Arena.

### Character System

Characters are represented as NFTs with the following attributes:
- Level
- Power
- Skills
- Equipment slots

### Battle Mechanics

1. **Matchmaking**: Players can challenge opponents of similar level
2. **Turn-based Combat**: Strategic combat with skill selection
3. **Rewards**: Winners receive experience, tokens, and rare items
4. **Tournaments**: Regular tournaments with special prizes

## Technical Architecture

The Obelisk Arena protocol is built on a multi-chain architecture:

1. **Core Chain**: Ethereum for governance and token economics
2. **Layer 2**: Polygon for gameplay and lower transaction fees
3. **Cross-chain Bridge**: Support for assets from multiple blockchains

## Developer Integration

Developers can integrate with the Obelisk Arena protocol through:

1. **SDK**: JavaScript library for interacting with the protocol
2. **REST API**: Backend services for game data and matchmaking
3. **Smart Contract Interfaces**: Direct interaction with on-chain components

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Governance system and token launch
- **Phase 2**: Battle system implementation
- **Phase 3**: NFT marketplace integration
- **Phase 4**: Cross-chain expansion
- **Phase 5**: Developer tools and ecosystem growth
